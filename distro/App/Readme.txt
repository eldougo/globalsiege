Welcome to GlobalSiege and thank you for downloading this program.

GlobalSiege is a free military strategy game of world domination inspired by the famous Parker Brothers board game, RISK. More information can be found at the GlobalSiege home page at http://globalsiege.net

To install GlobalSiege, run GlobalSiege-v00.09.0313.exe and follow the installation prompts.

GlobalSiege has a step-by-step tutorial (Quick Start Guide) in the first part of the online documentation (http://globalsiege.net/docs/quick-start/). New players should read this section first, which shouldn't take more than ten minutes. You will find that once you learn the basic attack and move sequences, GlobalSiege is extremely quick and easy to play.

For anyone who would like to host online sessions, there is a heavily commented sample server configuration file in the GlobalSiege application's home directory named "Sample Session Config.mrc".

GlobalSiege has been released as open source under the GNU GPL v3. You can find the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/eldougo. Detailed GlobalSiege technical information for developers can be found in 'GlobalSiege Technical Manual.doc' in the source repository.

I hope you enjoy playing GlobalSiege and may all your victories be glorious.
